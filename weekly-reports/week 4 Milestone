	1.	Database Setup (setup_db.ts):
	•	Database Creation: Created the database bingo_game if it didn’t already exist.
	•	Table Creation: Set up the required tables (users, game_boards, cards, random_numbers, turns, chat_rooms, and messages).
	•	Foreign Key Constraints: Ensured proper relationships between tables using foreign keys (e.g., user_id, game_id).
	•	SQL Execution: Split SQL statements and executed each to create necessary tables.
	2.	Insert, Find, and Delete Operations (database_operations.ts):
	•	Insert User: Implemented a method for inserting a new user into the users table, ensuring no duplicate entries (checked for existing username or email).
	•	Find User by Username: Implemented a method to find users by their username and return user details.
	•	Delete User: Set up a method for deleting users by username (optional, with foreign key handling in place).
